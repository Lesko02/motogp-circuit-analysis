# MotoGP Circuit Analysis
### Introduction
Clustering done on KNIME, simple comparison beetween the k-means algorithm and DBscan algorithm with a MotoGP Circuits themed dataset.
### Dataset
The used dataset is a custom modified version of Mike Enting 	["MotoGP circuits"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikeenting/motogp-circuits) to better 
suit the usage and the readability of the results.
###Workflow KNIME
The uploaded KNIME Workflow allows you to explore the project to better understand the process behind the clustering and 
play with the dataset and parameters yourself.
### Conclusions
The conclusions about this study and the interpretation of the data can be found in the PDF file in this repository
